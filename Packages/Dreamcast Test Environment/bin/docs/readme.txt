  This tool was made to simplify the test for every Dreamcast episode of 
  Shenmue. It has been designed to generate in ONE click ready-to-use Nero 
  (.NRG) disc images, runnable in the nullDC emulator!
  
  Images generated by this tool are hacked .NRG images, it means it'll work only
  in virtual drive (in SCSI mode) with Daemon Tools and/or Alcohol 120%
  softwares. The nullDC emulator is the only one emulation software supported 
  by this technique. Unfortunately, if you're using Demul (which is another 
  great Dreamcast emu), the GDR plugin can't use these .NRG images.
  
  Now with that stuff, you have every tool to translate your Shenmue Dreamcast
  episode in your favorite language!

      II. USAGE /___/      						 
	
  Prerequists:
    a. The dump of the game you want to translate (best is GDI)
    b. The nullDC Dreamcast emulator (http://www.emudev.org/nullDC-new/)
    c. A virtual drive (Alcohol 52%/120% or Daemon Tools)
    d. A lot of disk space
	
  To use this, you'll need the Dreamcast game data of the episode you want to 
  translate. In case of you have dumped it from your Dreamcast, you can also 
  extract the needed files from your GDI dump with the tool included in this
  pack.
  
  1. If you have the GDI dump, use GD-ROM Explorer to extract it on the Addons
     page in the Shentrad Official Website.
  
  2. If you already extracted the game files from the GDI dump you can use the
     software by creating a preset with the UI.
	
  A ".nrg" file will be created on the directory. The IP.HAK is the hacked 
  version of the IP.BIN bootstrap file. It isn't needed but you can keep
  it if you want.
  
  The Nero Burning ROM image doesn't contains EDC and ECC sectors, which means
  it can't be directly read by nullDC. You must use a Virtual Drive like 
  Alcohol 52%/120% or Daemon Tools and mount the "shentest.nrg" file on it.
  
  If you have set the virtual drive settings in the application, the tool
  can auto-mount the generated image at the end of the process by checking
  the appropriate option.

  Alternatively, you can manullay select the Virtual Drive on nullDC:
    a. Run nullDC
    b. Select "File" > "Normal Boot"
    c. In the "Select Image File" dialog box, enter "X:\" where "X:" is the
       letter of the Virtual Drive.

  After mounting the image, if the nullDC parameters are set, you can 
  auto-start the emulation by checking the appropriate box in the main window.

 This test environment is based on the Selfboot Data/Data Pack v1.4 by 
 FamilyGuy. All credits goes to FamilyGuy, Xzyx987X, ECHELON, M$, Neoblast, 
 Indiket, DarkFalz and jj1odm for this nice and very fast image generation 
 method.

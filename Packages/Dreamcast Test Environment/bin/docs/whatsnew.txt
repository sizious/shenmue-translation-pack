  The tool was COMPLETELY rewritten in Delphi.

  Major features include:
   * Presets: You can manage many profiles (i.e. 1 for each disc).
   * Auto-mount: After the generation, images are mounted automatically.
   * Emulation: If you enable the auto-mount option, the nullDC emulator can be
                started.
   * Tray icon: If you minimize the window, the program is hidden and put in the
                tray icon (next to the timer shown in your taskbar).
   
  This tool was beta tested by many user through the official Facebook group,
  that's why it isn't labeled as *beta* anymore. If bugs are found, the tool'll
  be updated.

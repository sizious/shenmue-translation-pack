___| PACKAGiNG CONTENTS |_______________________________________________________
 
 Currently this pack contains a bunch of various tools :       

 * ADPCM Streaming Toolkit
   This toolkit was made to decode the Yamaha AICA ADPCM (.STR) to the RIFF 
   WAVE (.WAV) audio format. It isn't a required tool, but it can be useful to 
   help the translation process. Please note the AHX/ADX format is used too,
   in that case you'll need the CRI SDK.
   
 * AFS Utils
   This tool allows opening, creating and editing AFS packages.
   
 * Cinematics Subtitles Editor
   This tool is the subtitles editor for SRF files which can be found in AFS
   packages. This format is used almost for cut scenes.  

 * Dreamcast Test Environment
   This tool was made to generate a Nero Burning Rom test image in order to 
   test your work in real-time with nullDC. You must mount the generated image
   in a Virtual Drive, otherwise, it doesn't work.
   
 * Font Utility
   This additional tool was made to edit the in-game fonts (for the menus, 
   subtitles, etc.).

 * Free Quest Subtitles Editor
   This tool is the subtitles editor for PAKS files inside the HUMANS.AFS
   package. This format is used almost for dialogues with NPC.

 * IDX Creator
   This stuff allows to re-create correct IDX files corresponding to each AFS.
 
 * IPAC Browser
   This utility was done to explore and edit PKS/PKF/BIN files.
  
 * Models Textures Editor
   This tool is a texture editor for MT5/MT6/MT7 files, in case of some sprites
   must be translated.
 
 * Notebook Editor
   This editor is used to modify the in-game Notebook.
  
 * Release Maker
   This program can create patchs release when you finish your translation
   project.

 * Sections Explorer
   This tool was made to do deep analysis on various Shenmue data files.
   
 * SPR Utils
   This's an editor for SPR files.
   
 * System Talk Subtitles Editor   
   This special subtitles editor was made in order to edit 'system subtitles'
   like the dialog shown when it's time to go for sleep in the game.

 * VMU Screen Editor

   translate some actions (for example "Saving"...).

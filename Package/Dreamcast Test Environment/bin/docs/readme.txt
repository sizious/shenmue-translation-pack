      II. USAGE /___/      						 
	
  Prerequists:
    a. The dump of the game you want to translate (best is GDI)
    b. The nullDC Dreamcast emulator (http://www.emudev.org/nullDC-new/)
    c. A virtual drive (Alcohol 52%/120% or Daemon Tools)
    d. A lot of disk space
	
  To use this, you'll need the Dreamcast game data of the episode you want to 
  translate. In case of you have dumped it from your Dreamcast, you can also 
  extract the needed files from your GDI dump with the tool included in this
  pack.
  
  1. If you have the GDI dump, use GD-ROM Explorer to extract it on the Addons
     page in the Shentrad Official Website.
  
  2. If you already extracted the game files from the GDI dump you can use the
     software by creating a preset with the UI.
	
  A ".nrg" file will be created on the directory. The IP.HAK is the hacked 
  version of the IP.BIN bootstrap file. It isn't needed but you can keep
  it if you want.
  
  The Nero Burning ROM image doesn't contains EDC and ECC sectors, which means
  it can't be directly read by nullDC. You must use a Virtual Drive like 
  Alcohol 52%/120% or Daemon Tools and mount the "shentest.nrg" file on it.
  
  To select the Virtual Drive on nullDC:
    a. Run nullDC
    b. Select "File" > "Normal Boot"
    c. In the "Select Image File" dialog box, enter "X:\" where "X:" is the
       letter of the Virtual Drive.

RETRIEVING SUBTITLES TRANSLATED WITH EARLIER VERSION OF THIS EDITOR
###################################################################

This new version of the Free Quest editor (NPC Editor) was entierly rewritten 
and include now the *CORRECT NPC* hacking algorithm.

If you have already translated NPC files using older versions of this FQ editor 
(like v1.02), I have a bad news for you. You worked hard for nothing (joking!).
If you have never used this editor before, you aren't concerned.

In fact, each file hacked by a earlier version than v2.0 are *BAD HACKED* and
will *DON'T* work in the newest editor / console.

But don't panic. Please follow this tutorial to learn how to recover your hard 
work, eg. your translated subtitles made with messed up editor versions.

---| WHATS UP ?? |-------------------------------------------------------------

USING THESE OLD *BAD HACKED* FILES WILL WORK RANDOMLY IN YOUR CONSOLE AND WILL
NOT WORK IN THE NEWEST EDITOR.

Also, another cool news is that using theses *BAD HACKED* files with the newest 
editor will CORRUPT these *BAD HACKED* files with never possibility to 
retrieve previous translation.

Yeah, the v1.02 editor was not final and I discovered that it corrupts some 
files because we handled too many special cases. So, all PAKS files was 
correctly displayed in the v1.02 editor but weren't working in-game. Finally,
I decided to rewrite the hacking code after many research.

---| TUTORiAL |----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Extract this converter.zip package somewhere (I call it "BAD_PKS").

2. Copy each *BAD HACKED* NPC PAKS files in the same directory ("BAD_PKS") where 
   you has extracted the converter package.

3. Run the "batconv.cmd" converter from the "BAD_PKS" directory. In the DOS box, 
   enter 1 or 2, depending of your file extensions. Wait the process end.
   
4. You should have now a lot of ".xml" files in the "BAD_PKS" folder that 
   contain subtitles extracted from *BAD HACKED* files. These ".xml" files must 
   be imported into *CLEAN* NPC files. To get *CLEAN* NPC files, simply get 
   them from a clean HUMANS.AFS extraction. Extract these new files in a 
   directory of your choice (I call it "CLEAN_PKS").
   
5. You can delete everything in the working directory ("BAD_PKS"), except 
   extracted ".xml" files, of course. You should have kept ".xml" files gotten 
   in the step 4. The purpose now is to inject every ".xml" in clean NPC files.
   
6. Then now you should have on your disk:
     - "BAD_PKS"   : Contain every ".xml" extracted from *BAD HACKED* PKS.
     - "CLEAN_PKS" : Contain every clean NPC PAKS extracted from HUMANS.AFS.
   Run the NPC Editor and select the "CLEAN_PKS" directory 
   (File > Open directory main menu command).

7. You should have in the left each clean PAKS. Now, select Tools > Batch
   Import subtitles... menu command.
   
8. In the source directory input field, select the "BAD_PKS" directory.
   Click the "Import" button.
   
9. You have successfully retrieved your translated subtitles!

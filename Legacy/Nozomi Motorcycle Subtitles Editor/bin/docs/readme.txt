 __| Shenmue Nozomi Motorcycle Subtitles Editor |_______________________________

  This editor is a subtitles editor for ONE special sequence used in this game:
  "Nozomi and the Motorcycle". This cinematic is played at the end of the game 
  and is therefore only present on the CD3.
  
  This editor does nothing else translating this special scene.
 
  The supported games are:
    - Shenmue I (NTSC-U/PAL) (DC)
    - US Shenmue (NTSC-J) (DC)

  Note that NTSC-J version of Shenmue I isn't supported, for the simple and 
  good reason that there are no subtitles to be edited in this version.

  This utility exists only for the Dreamcast, because the first episode is only 
  available on this system.
 __         ____________________________________________________________________
 __| USAGE |____________________________________________________________________

  First, you need to know that there are two versions of this cinematic in the 
  game: one on the CD3 (shown in the normal game progress) and the CD4 
  (displayed in the "Theatre" mode of the Passport CD). The editor supports the 
  modification of both versions.
   
  - To translate the scene of the CD3:
    Go to the folder "./SCENE/03/NBIK/" then open the "MAPINFO.BIN" file with 
    the tool.

  - To translate the scene of the CD4
    Go to the folder "./SCENE/99/NBIK/" then open the "MAPINFO.BIN" file with 
    the tool.

  The editor usage is the same as other subtitles editors of this pack.

  Once you have completed the translation, simply replace the edited 
  "MAPINFO.BIN" file in the correct folder.

  This utility is dedicaced to IlDucci of Sega Saturno. Thank you for having me 
  shown the problem and especially where were located the files to edit.
  
  For the guys at AM2, really, I wonder why you did that stuff. Why you haven't
  used the usual SRF system? You really developed this game with short delay...
  
  For the complete credits, go to the "About" box.

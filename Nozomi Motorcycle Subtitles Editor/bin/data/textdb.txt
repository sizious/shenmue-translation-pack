"Like a dream I once saw,•it passes by as it touches my cheek."
"This street leading to the ocean•carries the smell of sea."
"Before love makes me tell a white lie."
"This loneliness...•I want you to hold it in your arms now."
"If you will always be by my side,"
"there'll be no sorrow or tears in my eyes."
"Can't live without you.•Why did you have to decide?"
"You won't be aware of my pains and lies."
"Don't leave me alone, stay with me."
"I don't know if you'll ever look back."
"I'll remember you forever."

"What's the goal of this project ?";"The main goal of this project is to provide tools allowing you translating every Shenmue episode (including <em>What's Shenmue</em>, <em>Shenmue I</em> and <em>Shenmue II</em>) in another language."
"OK... But I don't understand very well. Shenmue is already available in &lt;put your language here&gt; ... right ?";"Sorry, but it's false. Whatever the Shenmue version you have, PAL or NTSC-U, the in-game subtitles are <strong>always</strong> in English, even if you set the in-game language. Some text are translated (including title menu or game options) but the whole game itself is globally in English. The Japanese version, on the other side, contains both Japanese and English subtitles (<em>US Shenmue</em>) or only Japanese subtitles."
"Cool!! I can now play &lt;put your favorite Shenmue episode here&gt; in &lt;put your language here&gt; !";"True and false.

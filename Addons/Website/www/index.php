<h1>What's Shenmue ?</h1>

<p>Shenmue is a 1999 adventure game developed by SEGA-AM2 and published by Sega for the Sega Dreamcast, produced and directed by Yu Suzuki.
Suzuki coined a genre title, "FREE" (Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment), for the game, based on the interactivity and freedom he wanted to give to the player.</p>

<p>Suzuki intended to achieve this by simulating aspects of real life through the game, such as the day/night/sleep system, real time variable weather effects 
(unheard of in a game of this kind at the time) and various other interactive elements such as vending machines, arcades, and convenience stores.</p>

<p>Shenmue borrows gameplay from many different genres but largely consists of open-world adventure segments with real-time 3D battles interspersed throughout.
Shenmue was followed by a sequel, Shenmue II, with at least one more planned as a Dreamcast killer app series, although production on the series ended 
with the second game, leaving the story at an unresolved cliffhanger.</p>

<h1>Project Information</h1>

<p>It all started on the French <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metagames-eu.com/forums/dreamcast/projet-traduction-des-sous-titres-de-shenmue-1-et-2-a-65066.html">Metagames</a> 
forum. A lot of people were asking if Shenmue 1 or 2 were available in French language. 
The answer was always the same: None of Shenmue episode was translated in another language. All in-game subtitles are in English.</p>

<p>One day of reading yet another post about Shenmue, <strong>Manic</strong> decided to check if that was possible to modify the in-game subtitles. It worked fine. That was in 2006 and we're still going on!</p>

<p>The tools to modify cinematic subtitles for Shenmue 2 were released back in 2007. The NPC (Non-Playing Characters) subtitles tool was released in 2008.</p>

<p>Later, the tools were adapted to hack Shenmue 1 and What's Shenmue game files. <a target="_blank" href="http://sbibuilder.shorturl.com/">SiZiOUS</a> joined the team around 2008. 
He's the main coder of this project now.</p>

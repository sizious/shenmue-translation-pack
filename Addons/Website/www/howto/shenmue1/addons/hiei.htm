<P align=center><FONT size=6 face=Verdana><B>How to translate Shenmue 1 in your 
own language !</B></FONT> </P>
<HR>
<FONT size=2 face=Verdana>
<H3>[STEP 1 : GET AN ISO VERSION OF YOUR ORIGINAL GD-ROMS]</H3>
<P>First, the best is to have a complete dump of Shenmue 1 (aka "no-ripped" like 
Kalisto's one). Kalisto's one is working fine though, but hey, it's easy to find 
a good "untouched" one so why bothering using the modified one (and with a 
complete one, it'll be a "PAL" one so you'll have the few things which were 
already translated, depending of the language you choose in the DC menu).</P>
<P>To find the complete version, contact me to <A 
href="mailto:scripts-elysion@hiei-tf.fr">scripts-elysion@hiei-tf.fr</A> and I'll 
help you.</P>
<HR>

<H3>[STEP 2 : COPY THE FILES OF THE GAME ON YOUR HARD DRIVE]</H3>
<P>Once you have the complete (or not) files, if it's a .CDI ISO for example, 
mount it on Deamon Tools (or whatever "Virtual CD/DVD-ROM program" you want) and 
copy all the files of the disc in a directory on your hard drive.</P>
<HR>

<H3>[STEP 3 : DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAMS YOU'LL NEED]</H3>
<P>Now, you'll need Manic programs for most of the work, you can get them here 
:</P>
<P><A href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=210353" 
target=_blank>https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=210353</A></P>
<P>You'll need to download the following ones :</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A 
  href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=210353&amp;package_id=252697&amp;release_id=614517"

  target=_blank>SPR Utils (v2.01)</A></LI></UL>
<P>You'll also need some other programs done by some other peoples :</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="http://www.hiei-tf.fr/shenmue_1_other_tools/pvr2png.rar" 
  target=_blank>PVR2PNG</A> 
  <LI><A href="http://www.hiei-tf.fr/shenmue_1_other_tools/WinPVR.rar"

  <LI><A 
  href="http://www.hiei-tf.fr/shenmue_1_other_tools/bootmake_11_cdi4dc_02b.rar" 
  target=_blank>BootMake</A></LI></UL>
<P>
<P>And those two files (modified by myself) :</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="http://www.hiei-tf.fr/shenmue_1_other_tools/1ST_READ.rar" 
  TARGET_?blank?>1ST_READ.BIN</A> 
  <LI><A href="http://www.hiei-tf.fr/shenmue_1_other_tools/IP.rar" 
  target=_blank>IP.BIN</A></LI></UL>
<P>With all those programs, you are ready to fully translate Shenmue 1 (texts 
and images)</P>
<HR>

<H3>[STEP 4 : EXTRACT .AFS FILES TO GET THE .SRF FILES]</H3>
<P>First thing to know, texts are (on the first disc), in the \SCENE\01\STREAM\ 
directory.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Load <B>AFS Utils</B> (leave <B>default options</B>). 
  <LI>Go to <B>File =&gt; Open directory</B> (CTRL+ALT+O) 
  <LI>Choose the <B>\SCENE\01\STREAM</B> directory then click on <B>OK</B>. 
  <LI>Now, click on the first file of the <B>Files list</B>. 
  <LI>Go to <B>Tools =&gt; Mass extraction</B>. 
  <LI>Choose the directory where the files will be extracted 
  (<B>Shenmue1-Texts</B> for example, then click on <B>OK</B>. 
  <LI>Each .AFS file should have been extracted in their own directory 
  (<B>01BEDA.AFS</B> =&gt; <B>\01BEDA\</B>, etc...)</LI></UL>
<P>You can now close <B>AFS Utils</B>.</P>
<HR>

<H3>[STEP 5 : OPEN THE .SRF FILES TO GET THE DIALOGS SCRIPT OF THE GAME]</H3>
<P>Now, open <B>Shenmue Aio Subtitles Editor</B> (again, leave <B>default 
options</B>), then :</P>
<H3>[FIRST METHOD]</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Go to <B>File =&gt; Open directory</B>. 
  <LI>Choose the first sub-directory of <B>\Shenmue1-Texts\</B>, in this 
  example, <B>01BEDA</B>, then click ok. 
  <LI>The name of the .SRF file will appear on the left, click on it to 
  highlight it. 
  <LI>Go to <B>Tools =&gt; Export subtitles</B>. 
  <LI>You'll have the choice between .xml and .txt format, choose the one you 
  prefer (personally I choose .txt, easier to edit) 
  <LI>Choose a directory where the .txt (or .xml) file will be created, then 
  choose a name for the file (I advice you to keep the same name as the 
  directory, will prevent some possibilities of interchanging two .txt files by 
  error.</LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Repeat the same thing for the others sub-directory.</LI></UL>
<P><B><U>Notes :</U></B></P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>HUMANS</B> directory don't have any .srf files and is not used for the 
  translation so just ignore this directory. 
  <LI><B>FREE01</B> directory have a lot of .srf files, unfortunately, you'll 
  have to extract each .txt manually. 
  <LI>Some .SRF files will only contained some weird characters. Ignore those 
  files, they are not used in the game. Those files seems to be some japanese 
  sentences of scenes which weren't used in the actual game (and so, I think 
  they don't bothered themself to translated them in English, which would have 
  been useless). Just delete the directories related to them (on the first disc 
  : <B>\01BUS\</B>, <B>\01NEK\</B>, <B>\A0134\</B>, <B>\A0142\</B>, 
  <B>\SA1008\</B>, <B>\SA1092\</B>, <B>\SY01\</B>, <B>\SY02\</B>, <B>\SY03\</B>, 
  <B>\SY04\</B>, <B>\SY05\</B> and <B>\SY06\</B>. I think I don't forgot any, 
  but just check to be sure.</LI></UL>
<P>Then, translate all the files.</P>
<P>Here's a sample of the extracted texts (01BEDA) :</P>
<P><B>&lt;# START OF THE SCRIPT SAMPLE #&gt;</B></P>
<P>01BEDA.SRF<BR>13<BR>----------<BR>1<BR>AKIR<BR>Fuku-san!<BR>----------<BR>2<BR>AKIR<BR>Lan 
Di!!<BR>----------<BR>3<BR>AKIR<BR>What?<BR>----------<BR>4<BR>AKIR<BR>Not a 
chance.<BR>----------<BR>5<BR>AKIR<BR>I will avenge my father's 
death!<BR>----------<BR>7<BR>AKIR<BR>Uhhhgghh=@<BR>----------<BR>8<BR>FUKU<BR>I'll 
never tell you where Ryo-san is.<BR>----------<BR>10<BR>FUKU<BR>Ryo-san! Don't 
do it!<BR>----------<BR>11<BR>SORY<BR>I heard there's another 
mirror.<BR>----------<BR>12<BR>SORY<BR>Give it to me 
now.<BR>----------<BR>13<BR>SORY<BR>If that's the way you want it,¡õI'll just 
take it from you.</P>
<P><B>&lt;# END OF THE SCRIPT SAMPLE #&gt;</B></P>
<UL>
  <LI>First line is the name of the .SRF file the .txt file have been created 
  from (<FONT color=red><B>DON'T MODIFY IT</B></FONT>). 
  <LI>Next line is the numbers of dialogs in the .txt file (<FONT 
  color=red><B>DON'T MODIFY IT</B></FONT>). 
  <LI>Nexts lines are the characters' scripts (Line number, ID of the character 
  who talks, text the character says. <FONT color=red><B>ONLY MODIFY THE TEXT 
  LINE, NOT THE LINE NUMBER NOR ID OF THE CHARACTER</B></FONT>). 
  <LI>The last line is here to separate the dialogs lines (<FONT 
  color=red><B>DON'T MODIFY IT</B></FONT>).</LI></UL>
<P>About the dialog lines, here's some thing to know.</P>
<P><FONT color=red><B>=@</B></FONT> is <FONT color=red><B>...</B></FONT> in the 
game.</P>
<P><B>¡õ</B> is the line-break (the dialogs after it are displayed on the bottom 
line). Each line can display 44 characters (even if it's sometimes depend of the 
characters' size). If you don't want to hide part (or totally) of the watch on 
the bottom-right corner, you'll have to only use 36 characters (again, a bit 
less or more depending of each characters' size).</P>
<P>If during the beta-test of your translation, some sentences are going out of 
the screen and are misplaced in the screen, it's mean you exceed the character 
limit of one of the lines (if there are two lines), or of the line (if there's 
only one).</P>
<P>Reduce the number of characters (by adding a <B>line-jump</B> for example if 
there's only one line, to "cut it" in two lines). If there are already two 
lines, try to reduce a bit the length of your sentence, it's the only actual 
know limit of the game. The game don't offer to push a button to display 
following lines (only two per sentence), so I don't think this limitation can be 
breaked.</P>
<P>About the accents, here's the one which can be used for the dialogs lines 
:</P>
<P>ä / Ä / â / Â /á / À / à / Á / ï / Ï / î / Î / í / Í / ë / Ë / ê / Ê / é / É 
/ è / È / ö / Ö / ô / Ô / ü / Ü / û / Û / ù / Ù / ç / Ç / ñ / Ñ / ß / ¿ / ¡</P>
<P>Some looks weird (like the <B>ç</B>) but we can't modify them without knowing 
where the font is localized in the game files (and even after that, we would 
have to find how to modify it so we wouldn't maybe be able to do it at least, 
but it costs nothing to try)</P>
<P>Some will probably be missing for some languages, but it seems the font can't 
be localized, and so, modified. If someone find where the font is (it's not the 
<B>ASCII.PVR</B> of the <B>\FONT\</B> directory), will free to post here (in 
english) and explain which file is used for the font (and if you know how to 
modify it, it's again better) :</P>

<H3>[STEP 6 : INSERT BACK THE TRANSLATED .SRF FILES (AS WELL AS .STR FILES) IN 
SOME NEW .AFS FILES]</H3>
<P>Once all the texts are translated (or only a bit, if you want to test 
before), then :</P>
<H3>[IF YOU CHOOSE THE FIRST METHOD DURING THE PREVIOUS STEP (5)]</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Load <B>Shenmue Aio Subtitles Editor</B>. 
  <LI>Go to <B>File =&gt; Open directory</B>. 
  <LI>Open the first sub-directory of your <B>Shenmue1-Texts</B> (<B>01BEDA</B> 
  in this example) 
  <LI>Click on the filename (01BEDA.SRF) in the files list to highlight it. 
  <LI>Go to <B>Tools =&gt; Import subtitles</B> =&gt; Choose the .txt or .xml 
  files of the translated subtitle (<FONT color=red><B>BE SURE TO LOAD THE .XML 
  SUBTITLE FILE IF YOU DECIDED TO USE THE .XML FORMAT, AND NOT THE .XML 
  FILE</B></FONT> (01BEDA_list.xml here) <FONT color=red><B>WHICH CONTAINS THE 
  FILES LIST OF THE ORIGINAL .AFS FILE)</B></FONT>. That's why I would advice to 
  use the .txt format (that, and the thing .txt as easier to handle, but it's 
  your choice).</LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Repeat the same thing for the others sub-directory.</LI></UL>
<P>Once all the .txt files have been imported back in the .SRF files, you can 
close <B>Shenmue Aio Subtitles Editor</B>.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Load <B>AFS Utils</B> again. 
  <LI>Go to <B>Tools =&gt; AFS Creator</B>. 
  <LI>Go to <B>File =&gt; Import XML List</B>. 
  <LI>Choose your <B>Shenmue1-Texts</B> directory, then the first sub-directory 
  (<B>01BEDA</B> in this example), then open the .xml in it. 
  <LI>Go to <B>File =&gt; Save As</B>, choose a name for the created file (use 
  the original ONLY, so <B>01BEDA.AFS</B>), then save it.</LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Repeat the same thing for the others sub-directory. (the creation of the 
  FREE01.AFS will take a while, contrary to all the other ones which are near 
  "instant created" but it's normal, the FREE01 file contains 633 Kb of file, 
  when all the other ones together are only 145,17 Kb big.</LI></UL>
<P>Once all the .AFS files (the ones which have modified texts) are created, you 
can now close <B>AFS Utils</B>.</P>
<H3>[IF YOU CHOOSE THE OTHER METHOD DURING THE PREVIOUS STEP (5)]</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Load <B>AFS Utils</B> again. 
  <LI>Go to <B>Tools =&gt; AFS Creator</B>. 
  <LI>Go to <B>File =&gt; Import XML List</B>. 
  <LI>Choose your <B>Shenmue1-Texts</B> directory, then the first sub-directory 
  (<B>01BEDA</B> in this example), then open the .xml in it. 
  <LI>Go to <B>File =&gt; Save As</B>, choose a name for the created file (use 
  the original ONLY, so <B>01BEDA.AFS</B>), then save it.</LI></UL>

  when all the other ones together are only 145,17 Kb big.</LI></UL>
<P>Once all the .AFS files (the ones which have modified texts) are created, you 
can now close <B>AFS Utils</B>.</P>
<HR>

<H3>[STEP 7 : CREATE NEW "VALID" .IDX FILES FROM THE NEW .AFS (TRANSLATED) 
FILES]</H3>
<P>Load <B>IDX Creator for Shenmue</B></P>
<P>From now, I advice you to create a directory separated from others with all 
the originals AFS/IDX of the <B>STREAM</B> directory.</P>
<P>Then, to rename each file like that :</P>
<P><B>01BEDA.AFS</B> =&gt; <B>01BEDA-US.AFS</B><BR><B>01BEDA.IDX</B> =&gt; 
<B>01BEDA-US.IDX</B><BR><B>01BEDB.AFS</B> =&gt; 
<B>01BEDB-US.AFS</B><BR><B>01BEDB.IDX</B> =&gt; <B>01BEDB-US.AFS</B></P>
<P>etc...</P>
<P>Why do I advice to do that ?</P>
<P>Because the IDX Creator need the original .AFS/IDX files to create new 
"valid" IDX files from your modified ASF files.</P>
<P>You don't have to do it if you want, but it's easier like that, and it'll 
prevent some confusions of files during the creation of the .IDX files, and so, 
somes errors (but again, it's just an advice, do like you want).</P>
<P>Then :</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Check the <B>Create with template</B> box. 
  <LI>In <B>Original IDX</B> line, choose the original game one (in my previous 
  example with my method, <B>01BEDA-US.IDX</B>) 
  <LI>In <B>Original AFS</B> line, choose the original game one (in my previous 
  example with my method, <B>01BEDA-US.AFS</B>)</LI></UL>
<P>Then, in the <B>Needed files</B> part :</P>
<UL>
  <LI>In <B>Modified AFS</B> line, choose the modified one (in my previous 
  example with my method, <B>01BEDA.IDX</B>) 
  <LI>In <B>New IDX</B> line, choose a name of the new one (in my previous 
  example with my method, <B>01BEDA.IDX</B>)</LI></UL>
<P><B><U>Notes :</U></B> 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Modified AFS</B> =&gt; The one created in the <B>Step 6</B> (which 
  contains the .srf modified for the translation, the others files are the 
  voices, I didn't say it before, but <B><FONT color=red>DON'T MODIFY THE VOICES 
  (.STR) FILES)</FONT></B>. 
  <LI><B>New IDX</B> =&gt; The new IDX file which will be created to match our 
  <B>Modified AFS</B> (because you need a new one if you modify the AFS files. 
  If you use the old one (original game one), it won't work.</LI></UL>
<P>Once all the <B>new IDX</B> are created, you can now close <B>IDX Creator for 
Shenmue</B>.</P>
<P>You can already copy all the new .AFS/.IDX files (overwriting the original 
ones) in the <B>\SCENE\01\STREAM\</B> directory, then recreating a .CDI file 
(with BootMake) but there are, yet, two others things to do if you want (<B>STEP 
8 &amp; 9</B>). The recreation of the .CDI file with BootMake is explained in 
the <B>STEP 10</B>. 
<HR>

<H3>[STEP 8 : EDIT THE IMAGES IN THE GAME]</H3>
<P>* To come later (will probably make a complete list of the files which have 
to be modified, listing them during my own modifications for the french version) 
*</P>
<HR>

<H3>[STEP 9 : EDIT THE ITEMS, PLACES NAMES, SUB-MENUS, NOTEBOOK, ETC...]</H3>
<P>* To come later (explanations are depending if a program is done by Manic to 
handle it or not. If not, I'll make a list of all the things which have to be 
modified, and how to do it with a hexadecimal editor, although I think it won't 
be easy to understand explanations of the use of an hexadecimal editor) *</P>
<HR>

<H3>[STEP 10 : CREATE AN AUTO-BOOTABLE .CDI CD-IMAGE FROM THE GAME FILES]</H3>
<P>First, extract "bootmake_11_cdi4dc_02b.rar" in a directory. Then, extract 
"1ST_READ.RAR" &amp; "IP.RAR" and copy the two extracted files ("1ST_READ.BIN" 
&amp; "IP.BIN") in the root of your shenmue directory files (by overwriting the 
original ones). 
<P>Now, run "BootMake" and configure it like this :</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Volume name :</B> You can put leave the default values, but you can 
  also change it. It's the name of the disc that will be displayed when you put 
  the disc in a PC CD-ROM drive (for example). In this example, I put 
  <B>SHEN1GD1</B>. 
  <LI><B>Source directory :</B> Choose the root of the directory where your 
  shenmue files are. In this example, <B>C:\SHEN1GD1_PAL-FR</B>. 
  <LI><B>IP.BIN :</B>Choose the IP.BIN which is in the root of your shenmue 
  files directory. In this example, <B>C:\SHEN1GD1_PAL-FR\IP.BIN</B>. 
  <LI><B>Temp ISO :</B> Choose the directory where the .ISO (temporary file 
  which will be made for the .CDI creation. Once the .CDI will be created, the 
  .ISO will be automatically deleted). In this example, <B>C:\temp.iso</B>. 
  <LI><B>Destination file</B> : Choose the directory where the .CDI CD-IMAGE 
  will be created (the final .cdi file, so the translated game). In this 
  example, <B>C:\SHEN1GD1_PAL-FR.CDI</B>.</LI></UL>
<P>Then, click on the "Make" button. A command-line window should appear. Wait 
until you see this message (in light blue color) : <B>Woohoo... All done OK! You 
can burn it now (TO A CD-RW PLEASE... BETA VERSION !!!) ...</B>, <B>Please push 
a key to continue...</B></P>
<P>Don't mind the "Beta-Version" warning, it worked perfectly for many peoples 
who used it so far, so it's a stable version. Now the last thing to do is to 
burn it to a CD-R then try it on your DreamCast, or you might prefer to mount it 
with Deamon Tools (or other program like it), and try it on an emulator.</P>
<P>For the English Voices versions, every disc should fit on 80min CD-R (by 
removing the CD-DA tracks if necessary). If it don't fit, just ask on the forum 
I gave the link several times, and someone will say you what to remove, and how 
if needed.</P>
<P>For the Japanese Voices versions, you'll need 99min CD-R (DreamCast read them 
fine) because the Japanese Voices are bigger than the English ones. Same as the 
English Version, if it don't fit on a 99min CD-R, just post on the forum and 
someone will say you what to remove, and how if needed.</P>

<H3>[STEP 11 (FINAL) : MAKE A LITTLE PATCH TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR TRANSLATION]</H3>* 
To come later (when Manic will have done the patcher program. The patch will be 
something like 10 Mb big and not 300 Mb big like .ips/.ppf/xdelta patchs or 
such) *
<P></P>
<HR>

<H3>[STEP 12 (OPTIONAL) : INSERT THE JAPANESE VOICES IN THE PAL VERSION]</H3>
<P>Basically, you just have to delete all the files of the PAL Version 
<B>STREAM</B> directory and then copy the all the files of the Japanese Version 
<B>STREAM</B> directory in it.</P>
<P>The only problem will be that doing that will replace English Subs by 
Japanese ones. So if you want to make a version with Japanese Voices, you have 
only two choices :</P>
<UL>
  <LI>To read Japanese. You can then extract all the japanese game texts from 
  the .AFS/.SRF files with the same method as the english one. Then, if you read 
  japanese, you just have to copy-paste your translation on the good sentences 
  (sometimes, the lines numbers match the english one, but sometimes not, so you 
  can't only rely on the number lines). 
  <LI>To wait until the french translation (the one with japanese voices) is 
  released. Once it'll be released, you'll be able to download the patchs, to 
  apply them on your PAL Version, then to extract the texts of both versions 
  with the same method I explained in this tutorial. Then, you can use both 
  scripts (by comparing them) to see which line number (in the english voices 
  version) match with the same one in the japanese voices version. 
  <LI>Mosts all others things are the same for the modification of the japanese 
  voices version. <B>AFS Utils</B> handle Japanese AFS files without problem, 
  same for <B>IDX Creator for Shenmue</B> (just use Japanese ones as source 
  instead of English ones, so rename the original ones 
  <B>FILENAME-JP.AFS/IDX</B> and use those ones instead of the 
  <B>FILENAME-US.AFS/IDX</B>. The only program which don't handle (in term of 
  display) japanese files is <B>Shenmue Aio Subtitles Editor</B> (maybe an 
  update will be made later if a way is found to display japanese text in a 
  Delphi program. If you know how, fill free to post on "Metagames Forums" (in 
  english), I gave the link a few times in this tutorial). So, in <B>Shenmue Aio 
  Subtitles Editor</B>, you have to export the japanese texts with the export 
  function, then open the .txt (or .xml) files with a word-processing program 
  (or whatever program which can display .txt/.xml files) which handle the 
  displaying of japanese characters. Notepad can do it if you have the right 
  options installed on Windows XP. JWPce can do it without any options installed 
  on Windows XP, etc...</LI></UL>
